# karatsubaAlgorithm
You are expected to develop an application that multiplies binary bit sequences in a way that reduces time complexity. 
Given two binary strings that represent value of two integers, find the product of two strings. 
The numbers should be 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits and the result should be in decimal. 
For example, if the first bit string is “1000” and second bit string is “1010”, output should be “80”. 
You are expected to multiply two randomly generated binary numbers by classical method and KaratsubaAlgorithm.
